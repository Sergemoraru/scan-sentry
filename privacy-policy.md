Privacy Policy — Scan Sentry
Effective date: February 2, 2026

Scan Sentry (“the App”) is a QR and barcode scanning application. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App.
Summary
The App does not require an account.
The App does not sell your personal information.
By default, the App processes scan content on your device.
If you enable History, scan contents are stored locally on your device.

Information We Collect
The App does not collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, or precise location.

The App may handle the following on your device:
Scan content (e.g., QR code text, URLs, Wi‑Fi QR strings)
Scan metadata (e.g., scan time, barcode type/symbology) if History is enabled

Camera Access
The App requests access to your device’s camera to scan QR codes and barcodes. Camera data is used only to detect codes and is not transmitted to us.

Photos Access (Optional)
If you choose to scan a code from an image, the App may request access to your photo library (or allow you to select a photo). Selected images are processed on-device to detect barcodes.

History Storage
If you enable “Save scans to History,” the App stores scan results locally on your device so you can view them later. You can delete items or clear your history at any time from within the App.

Links You Open
If you choose to open a scanned link, you may be taken to a website or in‑app browser. Those websites are governed by their own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third‑party websites.

Data Sharing
The App does not share your scan contents with the developer or any third parties.

Analytics and Tracking
The App does not include third‑party analytics SDKs and does not track you across apps and websites.

Data Security
Because scan data (including History) is stored locally on your device, your device’s security settings (passcode/Face ID, iOS protections) help protect it. You are responsible for securing access to your device.
Children’s Privacy
The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted at this URL with an updated effective date.
