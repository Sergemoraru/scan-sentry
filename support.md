Frequently Asked Questions
How do I scan a QR code?
Open Scan Sentry
Point your camera at the QR code inside the scan frame
Review the detected content, then choose Open / Copy / Share

The app won’t scan or the camera is blank
Make sure camera permission is enabled:
Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera → Scan Sentry → ON
Close and re-open the app
Clean the camera lens
Try better lighting or use the flashlight button

Can I scan from a photo?
Yes. Tap Photo and select an image containing a QR code or barcode.

Where is my scan history stored?
If “Save scans to History” is enabled, scan results are stored locally on your device. You can delete items or clear history anytime.

Does Scan Sentry automatically open links?
No. The app shows a review screen first. You choose whether to open the link.
The app says a link is risky — what does that mean?
Scan Sentry checks for common indicators of suspicious links (for example: unusual domains, encoded paths, or known tracking patterns). 
It’s a warning, not a guarantee—use caution before opening unknown links.
